# Detection of Optimal Range for Greenhouse Plant Growth
Overview

Our project focuses on enhancing greenhouse plant growth by developing a program for an Edge AI device. The primary objective is to enable the device to autonomously assess whether the current environmental conditions within the greenhouse are conducive to nurturing plant growth. By merging artificial intelligence with embedded systems, we aim to address the intricate requirements of modern agriculture using cutting-edge technology.

Key Components

1. HTU21D Humidity and Temperature Sensor: This sensor is pivotal for data acquisition, continuously gathering environmental data, particularly humidity and temperature levels. These parameters directly influence plant well-being, impacting physiological and metabolic processes crucial for growth.
2. Waveshare 1.3 inch OLED Screen: Integrated for user interaction and insightful feedback, this display provides real-time visualizations of collected data, AI-driven insights, and determinations regarding greenhouse conditions. It bridges the gap between technical AI complexities and practical greenhouse management.
3. STM32 Nucleo F401RE Microcontroller: Serving as the system's brain, this microcontroller coordinates the HTU21D sensor, Edge AI algorithms, and OLED display. It processes incoming data, executes AI models, and produces real-time reactions based on evaluated conditions, enabling intelligent decision-making.
